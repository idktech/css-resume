        <h2>Web developer + Dreamer</h2>
        <p>As a developer, I specialize in creating modular and scalable front-end architectures.
        As an educator, I focus on creating inclusive learning environments, instructor training and curriculum development.
        I'm also a certified <a href="http://www.ivaylo.me" target="_blank">BODYPUMP</a> Instructor for Some place</p>
        <p>I'M HUNGRY FOR SUCCESS.
        MY HUNGER IS FUELED BY MY PASSION.
        I belive anything is possible.
        I see opportunity when others see impossibility.
        I take risks. I'm focused. I hustle. I know that nothing is unrealistic.
        I contribute to something bigger than myself.
        I create. I learn. I grow. I do. I belive it's never too late to start living a dream.</p>

              <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                 Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                 when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
                 specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                 electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
                 the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                 and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including 
                 versions of Lorem Ipsum..</p>
